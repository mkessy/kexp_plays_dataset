# Comment Chunking Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of comment chunking for KEXP DJ comments, including analysis, evaluation, and final recommendations.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis ✅

- Analyzed existing comment structure in database
- Discovered 1.5M+ plays with 800K+ comments
- Identified need for chunking due to multi-paragraph comments

### Phase 2: Strategy Implementation ✅

- Implemented 4 chunking strategies:
  1. **Standard**: Split on `\n\n+` or `\n--+\n`
  2. **Aggressive**: Split on any `\n+`
  3. **Conservative**: Split on `\n\n\n+` or `\n---+\n`
  4. **Double newline**: Split on `\n\n+`
- Created `comment_chunks_raw` table with quality metrics
- Added URL detection and text quality analysis

### Phase 3: Temporal Analysis ✅

- Discovered dramatic shift in comment formatting around 2020
- Pre-2020: <2% of comments had multiple chunks
- Post-2020: 40-54% of comments have multiple chunks
- Average chunks per comment increased from ~2 to ~10-11

### Phase 4: LLM Evaluation ✅

- Evaluated 40 chunks (10 per strategy) using OpenAI GPT-4
- Rating criteria:
  - Semantic Completeness
  - Information Value
  - Standalone Clarity
  - Chunking Appropriateness

## Final Results

### Strategy Performance Rankings

1. **Conservative**: 4.83/5 (WINNER)

   - Perfect semantic completeness (5.0)
   - Excellent information value (4.8)
   - 0% URL-only chunks
   - Average chunk length: 214 chars

2. **Aggressive**: 4.05/5

   - Good balance across criteria
   - 20% URL-only chunks
   - Average chunk length: 134 chars

3. **Double newline**: 3.55/5

   - Simple pattern but lower clarity
   - 20% URL-only chunks
   - Average chunk length: 132 chars

4. **Standard**: 3.50/5
   - Highest URL-only chunks (30%)
   - Lower semantic completeness
   - Average chunk length: 87 chars

### Key Insights

- Conservative strategy provides best quality chunks
- URL-only chunks are a consistent problem across strategies
- Quality distribution: 50% excellent, 25% good, 20% fair, 5% poor
- Chunk quality strongly correlates with preservation of semantic boundaries

## Recommendations

1. **Use Conservative Strategy** for production embedding generation
2. **Implement URL handling**:
   - Pre-process to extract URLs
   - Post-process to merge URL-only chunks
   - Avoid splitting at URL boundaries
3. **Consider chunk length** for embedding models (avg 214 chars for conservative)
4. **Monitor temporal patterns** as comment formatting continues to evolve

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update `generate_comment_embeddings.py` to use conservative strategy
- [ ] Implement chunk filtering (quality thresholds)
- [ ] Add URL chunk post-processing
- [ ] Generate embeddings for all quality chunks
- [ ] Build semantic search interface
