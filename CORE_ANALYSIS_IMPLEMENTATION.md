# KEXP Core Analysis Views Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the core analysis views as specified in `docs/core_analysis.md` using the DuckDB Python API. The implementation adapts the original SQL specification to match the actual database schema discovered during analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Script: `create_core_analysis_views.py`

A Python script that uses the DuckDB Python API to:

1. Connect to the KEXP database (`kexp_data.db`)
2. Create foundational analysis views
3. Run sample metrics queries
4. Perform basic data quality checks

### Created Views

#### 1. `view_play_details`

**Purpose**: Enriched play details combining multiple dimensions
**Key Features**:

- Joins `fact_plays` with tracks, releases, shows, and programs
- Provides comprehensive play information in a single view
- Includes original text strings and normalized dimensions

#### 2. `view_artist_play_summary`

**Purpose**: Artist-level aggregations and statistics
**Key Features**:

- Total play counts per artist
- Distinct tracks played per artist
- Links to MusicBrainz artist IDs where available

#### 3. `view_track_comment_summary`

**Purpose**: Track-level comment analysis
**Key Features**:

- Total plays per track
- Count of plays with comments
- Concatenated comments for analysis
- Ready for NLP/LLM processing

#### 4. `view_show_host_details`

**Purpose**: Show and host relationship details
**Key Features**:

- Links shows to their hosts
- Provides easy access to show timing and host information

## Database Statistics (as of implementation)

- **Total Plays**: 2,143,091
- **Unique Tracks**: 726,522
- **Unique Artists**: 177,518
- **Total Shows**: 63,585
- **Plays with Comments**: 1,032,974 (48.2%)

## Top Artists by Play Count

1. Radiohead: 5,663 plays
2. LCD Soundsystem: 5,208 plays
3. David Bowie: 5,129 plays
4. The Cure: 4,513 plays
5. Beck: 4,141 plays

## Schema Adaptations Made

The implementation required adapting the original specification to match the actual database schema:

- Column names: `mb_id` instead of `musicbrainz_id`
- Column names: `mb_track_id`, `mb_recording_id` instead of `musicbrainz_track_id`, `musicbrainz_recording_id`
- Column names: `mb_release_id`, `mb_release_group_id` instead of `musicbrainz_release_id`, `musicbrainz_release_group_id`
- Simplified comment tokenization due to DuckDB function limitations

## Data Quality Findings

- **Excellent data integrity**: 0 plays with NULL track_id_internal or show_id
- **Rich comment data**: Nearly half of all plays include DJ comments
- **Comment length variety**: Comments range from 1 to 5,575 characters (avg: 197)

## Usage

### Running the Script

```bash
python create_core_analysis_views.py
```

### Using the Views

```sql
-- Get most commented tracks
SELECT track_song_title, total_plays, plays_with_comments
FROM view_track_comment_summary
ORDER BY plays_with_comments DESC;

-- Analyze artist popularity
SELECT artist_primary_name, total_plays, distinct_tracks_played
FROM view_artist_play_summary
ORDER BY total_plays DESC;

-- Rich play details for analysis
SELECT play_id, airdate_iso, comment, track_song_title, artist_primary_name
FROM view_play_details
WHERE comment IS NOT NULL;
```

## Next Steps

With these foundational views in place, you can now:

1. **NLP Analysis**: Process comments using LLMs for sentiment, themes, recommendations
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Study play patterns over time
3. **Host Analysis**: Examine DJ preferences and comment styles
4. **Music Discovery**: Identify relationships between artists, tracks, and audience engagement

## Files Created

âœ… **Implementation Status**: Complete and functional
ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Goal**: Enable efficient analysis of KEXP data with focus on comment analysis for LLM/NLP tasks
