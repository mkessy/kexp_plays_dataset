Okay, here's a simplified script specification for creating essential aggregation views and metrics directly within your DuckDB database. This focuses on the most important aspects of analyzing your normalized KEXP data, utilizing DuckDB's SQL features for efficiency.

This specification outlines SQL commands you would run in your DuckDB environment (e.g., DuckDB CLI, a Python script connected to DuckDB, or a SQL GUI).

---

## DuckDB: Core Data Exploration & Metrics Script Specification

**1. Objective**

To create a foundational set of SQL views and queries within DuckDB for immediate analysis of the normalized KEXP data. This will focus on understanding play activity, comment characteristics, key entity distributions, and basic data quality checks to support initial insights and prepare for more advanced NLP/LLM tasks.

**2. Input Data**

The 16 normalized tables previously loaded into your DuckDB database (e.g., `fact_plays`, `dim_artists_master`, `dim_tracks`, `bridge_play_to_artist`, etc.), with data types already corrected (e.g., TIMESTAMPS for dates, UUIDs where appropriate).

**3. Output**

- A series of useful, reusable SQL VIEWs created within DuckDB.
- Example SQL queries that generate key metrics and summary statistics.

**4. Core Script (DuckDB SQL Commands)**

**4.1. Foundational Views for Enhanced Querying**

These views pre-join key tables to simplify common analytical queries.

```sql
-- View: Enriched Play Details
-- Combines fact_plays with essential track, artist (primary name), release, and show information.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_play_details AS
SELECT
    fp.play_id,
    fp.airdate_iso,
    fp.comment,
    fp.play_type,
    fp.rotation_status,
    fp.is_local,
    fp.is_request,
    fp.is_live,
    fp.original_artist_text AS play_artist_text, -- Original artist string from the play
    fp.original_album_text AS play_album_text,   -- Original album string from the play

FROM
    fact_plays fp
LEFT JOIN
    dim_tracks dt ON fp.track_id_internal = dt.track_id_internal
LEFT JOIN

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_artist_play_summary AS
SELECT
    bpa.artist_id_internal,
    dam.primary_name_observed AS artist_primary_name,
    dam.musicbrainz_id AS artist_mbid,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bpa.play_id) AS total_plays,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fp.track_id_internal) AS distinct_tracks_played
FROM
    bridge_play_to_artist bpa
JOIN
    dim_artists_master dam ON bpa.artist_id_internal = dam.artist_id_internal
JOIN
    fact_plays fp ON bpa.play_id = fp.play_id -- To count distinct tracks from plays linked to the artist
GROUP BY
    bpa.artist_id_internal, dam.primary_name_observed, dam.musicbrainz_id;

-- View: Track Comment Summary
-- Aggregates comment information per track.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_track_comment_summary AS
SELECT
    dt.track_id_internal,
    dt.primary_song_title_observed AS track_song_title,
    COUNT(fp.play_id) AS total_plays,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fp.comment IS NOT NULL AND fp.comment != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS plays_with_comments,
    string_agg(fp.comment, ' ||| ') FILTER (WHERE fp.comment IS NOT NULL AND fp.comment != '') AS all_comments_concatenated,
    list_distinct(list_transform(string_split(lower(fp.comment), ' '), x -> trim(x, '.,!?;:"()'))) FILTER (WHERE fp.comment IS NOT NULL AND fp.comment != '') AS all_distinct_comment_tokens -- Example of advanced tokenization
FROM
    dim_tracks dt
JOIN
    fact_plays fp ON dt.track_id_internal = fp.track_id_internal
GROUP BY
    dt.track_id_internal, dt.primary_song_title_observed;

-- View: Show Host Details

    s.start_time_iso AS show_start_time,
    s.tagline_at_show_time,
    h.host_id,
    h.primary_name AS host_name
FROM
    dim_shows s
JOIN
    bridge_show_hosts bsh ON s.show_id = bsh.show_id
JOIN
    dim_hosts h ON bsh.host_id = h.host_id;
```

**4.2. Key Metrics & Statistics Queries**

These queries provide high-level summaries and identify areas for deeper investigation.

```sql
-- Overall Data Counts
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact_plays) AS total_plays,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_tracks) AS total_unique_tracks,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_artists_master) AS total_unique_artists,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_shows) AS total_shows;

-- Play Type Distribution
SELECT
    play_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM fact_plays
GROUP BY play_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Comment Analysis: Prevalence & Basic Stats
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN comment IS NOT NULL AND comment != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS plays_with_comments,
    COUNT(*) AS total_plays,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN comment IS NOT NULL AND comment != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_with_comments
FROM fact_plays;

SELECT
    MIN(length(comment)) AS min_comment_length,
    MAX(length(comment)) AS max_comment_length,
    ROUND(AVG(length(comment)), 2) AS avg_comment_length,
    ROUND(quantile_cont(length(comment), 0.5), 2) AS median_comment_length, -- Median
    ROUND(quantile_cont(length(comment), 0.95), 2) AS p95_comment_length   -- 95th Percentile
FROM fact_plays
WHERE comment IS NOT NULL AND comment != '';

-- Top N Most Played Tracks
SELECT
    track_song_title,
    track_id_internal,
    COUNT(play_id) AS play_count
FROM view_play_details -- Using the view for convenience
GROUP BY track_song_title, track_id_internal
ORDER BY play_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Top N Most Played Artists (from summary view)
SELECT
    artist_primary_name,
    artist_id_internal,
    total_plays
FROM view_artist_play_summary
ORDER BY total_plays DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Artists with multiple observed name strings
SELECT
    dam.artist_id_internal,
    dam.primary_name_observed,
    list_distinct(bann.observed_name_string) AS all_observed_names,
    array_length(list_distinct(bann.observed_name_string)) AS distinct_name_count
FROM dim_artists_master dam
JOIN bridge_artist_id_to_names bann ON dam.artist_id_internal = bann.artist_id_internal
GROUP BY dam.artist_id_internal, dam.primary_name_observed
HAVING array_length(list_distinct(bann.observed_name_string)) > 1
ORDER BY distinct_name_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Shows with the most plays
SELECT
    show_id,
    show_start_time,
    show_program_name,
    COUNT(play_id) AS plays_in_show
FROM view_play_details
GROUP BY show_id, show_start_time, show_program_name
ORDER BY plays_in_show DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**4.3. Data Quality & "Clean Up" Identification Queries**

These queries help identify potential issues or areas needing further investigation/cleaning.

```sql
-- Plays with NULL track_id_internal (potential mapping issue or genuinely no track linked)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS plays_with_null_track_id
FROM fact_plays
WHERE track_id_internal IS NULL;

-- Plays with NULL show_id (should be rare if plays always belong to a show)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS plays_with_null_show_id
FROM fact_plays
WHERE show_id IS NULL;

-- Artists in bridge_play_to_artist that are not in dim_artists_master (orphan check)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bpa.artist_id_internal) AS orphan_artist_links
FROM bridge_play_to_artist bpa
LEFT JOIN dim_artists_master dam ON bpa.artist_id_internal = dam.artist_id_internal
WHERE dam.artist_id_internal IS NULL;

-- Tracks in fact_plays that are not in dim_tracks (orphan check)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT fp.track_id_internal) AS orphan_track_links_in_plays
FROM fact_plays fp
LEFT JOIN dim_tracks dt ON fp.track_id_internal = dt.track_id_internal
WHERE dt.track_id_internal IS NULL AND fp.track_id_internal IS NOT NULL;

-- Comments that are very short (potential noise)
SELECT comment, length(comment) as len
FROM fact_plays
WHERE comment IS NOT NULL AND length(comment) > 0 AND length(comment) < 5 -- Example: less than 5 chars
ORDER BY length(comment)
LIMIT 20;

-- Plays with an original_artist_text but no corresponding MusicBrainz IDs in bridge_play_to_artist
-- (Highlights entities identified only by string, using their generated internal ID)
SELECT
    fp.play_id,
    fp.original_artist_text,
    dam.musicbrainz_id
FROM fact_plays fp
JOIN bridge_play_to_artist bpa ON fp.play_id = bpa.play_id
JOIN dim_artists_master dam ON bpa.artist_id_internal = dam.artist_id_internal
WHERE fp.original_artist_text IS NOT NULL AND dam.musicbrainz_id IS NULL -- Indicates a string-generated artist ID
LIMIT 20;
```

**5. Execution and Usage**

- Save these SQL commands into one or more `.sql` files.
- Execute them against your DuckDB database using its CLI (`duckdb kexp_normalized.duckdb -c ".read your_script.sql"`) or through the Python API by reading the file and executing its content.
- The VIEWS will persist in your DuckDB database for ongoing querying.
- The metric queries can be run as needed to get snapshots of your data characteristics.

This simplified script spec focuses on giving you immediate, actionable insights into your normalized KEXP data using DuckDB's strengths. The views provide reusable building blocks, and the metric queries offer starting points for deeper dives, especially into the comment data which is your primary interest for LLM/NLP tasks.
