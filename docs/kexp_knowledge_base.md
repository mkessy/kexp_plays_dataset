### KEXP Data Project: State Overview & Refined Plan

#### 1. Project Goal & Core Objective

The primary objective is to engineer the **best possible music exploration and discovery tool**. This will be achieved through a two-pronged strategy:

1.  First, building a foundational Knowledge Base (KB) from KEXP's structured play data and enriched MusicBrainz metadata.
2.  Second, and crucially, using advanced NLP (including LLM-guided frameworks like DSPy) to extract **novel semantic meaning** and relationships from unstructured DJ commentary.

The final tool will integrate traditional structured search with modern semantic and agentic search capabilities.

#### 2. Current Status: Phase 1 Complete, Entering Phase 2

- **Data Ingested & Normalized:** All raw KEXP and MusicBrainz data is processed and available in a DuckDB database.
- **Comments Processed:** DJ comments have been chunked and vectorized, with topic models generated via BERTopic.
- **Knowledge Base State:** The KB schema is created. **Phase 1 of population is complete**, with foundational entities (`kb_Genre`, `kb_Location`, `kb_Role`, `kb_Instrument`) loaded from MusicBrainz data.
- **Immediate Next Step:** We are now beginning **Phase 2: Core Knowledge Base Population**.

#### 3. High-Level Data Flow

The project pipeline remains the same:
`Raw Data (API/Dumps)` -> `Normalization (dim/fact tables)` -> `Comment Processing (Chunks & Embeddings)` -> `Topic Modeling` -> `Knowledge Base Population`

### Refined Project Plan

This plan operationalizes your feedback into a clear, phased approach.

#### **Phase 2 (Immediate Priority): Core Knowledge Base Population**

This phase focuses on fully leveraging existing structured data to build the KB's foundational skeleton.

- **Action:** Populate the core music entity tables: `kb_Artist`, `kb_Person`, `kb_Album`, `kb_Song`, and `kb_Release` by mapping from the normalized `dim_*` tables.
- **Action:** Establish the core, explicit relationships from the KEXP data, such as `rel_Artist_Performed_Song`, `rel_Song_Appears_On_Release`, and `rel_Release_By_Label`.
- **Action:** Create the `bridge_kb_*_to_kexp` tables to ensure full traceability between the new canonical KB entities and their original source records in the `dim_*` tables.

#### **Phase 3: Semantic & Novel Knowledge Extraction (NLP/LLM Focus)**

With the core KB established, we will execute on the primary goal of extracting new insights from the DJ comments.

- **Action:** Utilize the existing BERTopic models from `cluster_comments.py` as a starting point for identifying high-level themes.
- **Action:** Design and implement targeted **DSPy programs** to parse `comment_chunks_raw` for relationships not present in the structured data. Initial targets include:
  - **Influences & Comparisons:** ("sounds like", "influenced by")
  - **Collaborations & Side Projects:** ("features...", "side project of...")
  - **Sound & Mood Descriptors:** ("dreamy", "high-energy", "perfect for a rainy day")
- **Action:** Use the extracted information to enrich the KB by populating nuanced relationship tables and adding descriptive metadata (e.g., tags) to artists and songs.

#### **Phase 4: Building the Music Discovery Tool**

This phase builds the user-facing application, guided by the principle of single-machine performance on Apple Silicon.

- **Action:** Implement a **hybrid search** system using `vector_search.py` as a foundation. This will combine structured SQL queries on the KB with semantic vector search on comment embeddings.
- **Action:** Develop a lightweight **agentic search layer**. This system will use an LLM to interpret natural language queries, break them down into a sequence of database queries (both SQL and vector), and synthesize the results into a single, coherent answer for music discovery.

#### Guiding Principles

- **Performance:** All development will prioritize efficient, single-machine performance, with a specific focus on optimization for Apple Silicon (M3).
- **Validation:** In line with your direction, we will "verify as we build." Validation will be an ongoing, iterative process of running spot-check queries as the KB is populated, with formal evaluation datasets to be used in later stages.
